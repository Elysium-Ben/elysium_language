Elysium Manifesto



	Purpose:
		- Elysium is a programming language designed to be simple, intuitive, and powerful. It combines the ease of Python, 		the memory safety of Rust, and native support for modern technologies like AI/ML, blockchain, and quantum 			computing.



	Audience:
		- Data scientists, AI/ML researchers, systems programmers, blockchain developers, and quantum computing 			  enthusiasts.
	


	Key Features:
		- Python-like Syntax: Clean and readable syntax for easy learning and fast development.
		- Rust-like Memory Safety: Ownership and borrowing system for safe and efficient memory management.
		- Concurrency: Go-like lightweight tasks for scalable, high-performance applications.
		- AI/ML Integration: First-class support for machine learning and neural network development.
		- Quantum Computing: Simplified syntax for quantum algorithms and simulations.
		- Blockchain: Built-in support for decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts.
		- Clear Error Messages: Human-readable errors that guide developers to fix issues quickly.

	Elysium Limitations:
		- Elysium is not intended for ultra-low-level programming (like C for embedded systems).
		- It will prioritize simplicity and safety over extreme fine-tuning of performance (like in assembly languages).
