# Elysium Language Specification

This document defines the behavior and features of the Elysium programming language. It describes how the language handles variables, functions, memory, concurrency, error handling, and advanced features like AI/ML, quantum computing, and blockchain integration.

The goal of Elysium is to provide a simple yet powerful syntax that balances ease of use with modern capabilities such as memory safety, concurrency, and first-class support for emerging technologies.

## 1. Variables and Types

- Variables in Elysium must be declared with explicit types.
- Once a variable is declared with a type, it cannot be assigned a value of a different type.
- Supported primitive types include:
  - `int` for integers
  - `float` for floating-point numbers
  - `str` for strings of text
  - `bool` for boolean values (`True` or `False`)

**Example:**

```elysium
# Variable declarations with types
name: str = "Elysium"
age: int = 5
is_active: bool = True
height: float = 1.75


**Explanation:**

- Each variable is declared with its type (`str`, `int`, `bool`, `float`) followed by its name and value.
- This ensures the language knows what kind of data each variable holds, improving safety and clarity.

**Functions:**

```markdown
## 2. Functions

- Functions are declared using the `def` keyword.
- Parameters and return types must be explicitly typed.
- If a function does not return a value, its return type should be `None`.

**Example:**

```elysium
# Function that returns a string
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Function that does not return a value
def say_hello(name: str) -> None:
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")


**Explanation:**

- The `greet` function takes a `name` of type `str` and returns a `str`.
- The `say_hello` function takes a `name` of type `str` and returns `None` (it doesn't return a value but performs an action).

**Memory Safety (Ownership and Borrowing):**

```markdown
## 3. Memory Safety (Ownership and Borrowing)

- Elysium uses an ownership model to manage memory safely.
- **Ownership:**
  - Every value has a single owner.
  - When the owner goes out of scope (e.g., at the end of a function), the value is automatically cleaned up.
- **Borrowing:**
  - Values can be **borrowed** either immutably or mutably.
  - **Immutable Borrow (`&`):** Allows read-only access to a value.
  - **Mutable Borrow (`&mut`):** Allows read and write access but must be exclusive.

**Example (Mutable Borrow):**

```elysium
# Function that mutably borrows an integer
def increment_value(val: &mut int) -> None:
    val += 1

## 4. Concurrency

- Elysium supports concurrency using the `spawn` and `await` keywords.
- **Spawn:**
  - Creates a new concurrent task to execute a function.
- **Await:**
  - Pauses execution until a task completes.

**Example:**

```elysium
# Function to download data (placeholder)
def download_data(url: str) -> Data:
    # Implementation goes here
    pass

# Main function using concurrency
def main() -> None:
    url: str = "http://example.com/data"
    task = spawn download_data(url)
    await task  # Wait for the download to complete

## 5. Error Handling

- Elysium uses exceptions to handle errors.
- **Raise:**
  - Use the `raise` keyword to throw an exception.
- **Try/Except:**
  - Use `try` and `except` blocks to catch and handle exceptions.

**Example:**

```elysium
# Function that may raise an error
def divide(a: int, b: int) -> float:
    if b == 0:
        raise ZeroDivisionError("Cannot divide by zero.")
    return a / b

# Using try/except to handle the error
def safe_divide(a: int, b: int) -> None:
    try:
        result = divide(a, b)
        print(f"Result: {result}")
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")

## 6. AI/ML Integration

- Elysium provides built-in support for machine learning.
- Use the `@neural_network` decorator to define neural networks.
- Utilize native `Tensor` types and built-in functions for layers.

**Example:**

```elysium
@neural_network(input_shape=(784,), output_shape=(10,))
def build_model(x: Tensor) -> Tensor:
    x = dense_layer(x, units=128, activation="relu")
    x = dense_layer(x, units=10, activation="softmax")
    return x

## 7. Quantum Computing

- Elysium supports quantum programming constructs.
- **Quantum Registers:**
  - Use `quantum_register` to define qubits.
- **Quantum Gates:**
  - Functions like `apply_hadamard` and `apply_cnot` to manipulate qubits.

**Example:**

```elysium
# Define a quantum register with 2 qubits
qr = quantum_register(2)

# Apply quantum gates
apply_hadamard(qr[0])      # Apply Hadamard gate to qubit 0
apply_cnot(qr[0], qr[1])   # Apply CNOT gate between qubits 0 and 1

# Measure the qubits
result = measure(qr)
print(f"Quantum result: {result}")

## 8. Blockchain/Smart Contracts

- Elysium allows writing smart contracts using the `contract` keyword.
- Contracts can manage state and handle transactions.

**Example:**

```elysium
contract Token:
    def __init__(self, initial_supply: int):
        self.total_supply: int = initial_supply
        self.balances: dict[str, int] = {}

    def transfer(self, sender: str, receiver: str, amount: int) -> None:
        if self.balances.get(sender, 0) >= amount:
            self.balances[sender] -= amount
            self.balances[receiver] = self.balances.get(receiver, 0) + amount
        else:
            raise ValueError("Insufficient balance.")
