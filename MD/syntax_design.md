# Elysium Syntax Design 

## 1. Variables and Types
Elysium will use type annotations to ensure memory safety and clarity, similar to Python, but stricter:

```elysium
# Variable declaration with type
name: str = "Elysium"
age: int = 5
is_active: bool = True


## 2. Functions
Functions in Elysium use type annotations to enforce return types:

```elysium
# Function definition with type annotations
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"


## 3. Conditionals
Conditionals will follow Pythonâ€™s simple, readable style:

```elysium
if age > 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")


## 4. Loops
We will also adopt Python-like loops for simplicity:

```elysium
for i in range(5):
    print(i)


## 5. Memory Safety (Borrowing and Ownership)
Inspired by Rust, Elysium will enforce memory safety using an ownership model:

```elysium
# Ownership example
def increment_value(val: &mut int) -> int:
    val += 1
    return val


## 6. Concurrency (Tasks)
Concurrency will be modeled using a simple spawn and await syntax:

```elysium
# Spawn a new task
task = spawn download_data(url)
await task


## 7. AI/ML Integration (First-Class Support)
Elysium will support AI/ML with native syntax to define neural networks:

```elysium
@neural_network(input_shape=(784,), output_shape=(10,))
def build_model(x: Tensor) -> Tensor:
    x = dense_layer(x, units=128, activation="relu")
    x = dense_layer(x, units=10, activation="softmax")
    return x
